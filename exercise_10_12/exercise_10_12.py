# Exercises from the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.
# These exercises are about Storing Data and loading it using the json package.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Combine the two programs you wrote in Exercise 10-11 into one file.
# 1a. If the number is already stored,
# 1a.1. report the favorite number to the user.
# 1b. If not,
# 1b.1. prompt for the userâ€™s favorite number
# 1b.2 and store it in a file.
# Run the program twice to see that it works.
